An attempt at a basic parallel word-count program, using the new Julia language.

Example run:

Using http://norvig.com/big.txt,
julia -p 4 wcfile.j: 35.2 s
julia -p 1 wcfile.j: 52.3 s
speedup = 1.49
estimated parallel part (amdahl's law): 32.6%

The single-threaded reduce and file IO are the killers here, most likely.
